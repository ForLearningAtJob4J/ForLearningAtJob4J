### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the world reconstructing. It's a joke. Not yet )) Just looking for a job.

In all projects I work with postgreSQL (just for example, it is not a restriction of the only one RDBMS i can use) and all of them with no Spring framework yet, only a little piece of JavaEE - servlets. I am studying spring at the moment, so... Here are:

Small SPA project for GTD, front + RESTful back with auth + hibernate.

CLI grabber utility with http web server. It gets vacancies from sql.ru

CLI todo-like app. Hmm, it is here to show that I know about unit- and integrational-testing. (Actually you'd better not look at it - it is not a good project, but just a mess of some technologies ) Ok, i warned you )
